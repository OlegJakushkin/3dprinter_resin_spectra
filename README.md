## Spectrum Measurements for DLP-based 3D Printing

This repository contains spectrum measurements relevant to DLP-based stereolithographic 3D printers. Specifically, absorption spectrum measurements for various resins are included, as are emission spectra for several 3D printers and DLP optical engines. Spectral data processing calculations and analysis is contained in various Jupyter notebooks and python files. 

See `Absorbance_information_and_methods.ipynb` for further information.
