    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Measure absorption spectrum for 3D printer resins.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimental Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We use an Ocean Optics QE65-ABS scientific-grade spectrometer ([download pdf datasheet](http://oceanoptics.com/wp-content/uploads/OEM-Data-Sheet-QE65Pro.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Need figure with:\n",

    "## Measurement Method\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine a spectrometer integration time, $\\tau_{int}$, that uses most of the instrument's dynamic range for a given resin or set of resins. Use this integration time for measurements.\n",
    "1. Measure dark spectrum $N$ times: $d^i$ with $i \\in [1,N]$. This results in $N$ data files.\n",
    "1. Measure transmission spectrum of sample with no resin $N$ times: $u^i$ with $i \\in [1,N]$. This results in $N$ data files.\n",
    "1. Measure transmission spectrum of sample with resin $N$ times: $m^i$ with $i \\in [1,N]$. This results in $N$ data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $N$ does not have to be the same for the dark, no resin, and resin measurements. However, for convenience we typically choose the same $N$ for each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transmittance and Absorbance\n",
    "\n",
    "The transmittance of a sample, $T$, is the fraction of incident light that is transmitted through a sample, which is a function of wavelength,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T(\\lambda) = I_t(\\lambda)/I_i(\\lambda), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $I_i$ is the incident irradiance (power per unit area, W/cm$^2$) and $I_t$ is the transmitted irradiance. The transmittance can be written in terms of the absorbance, $A$, as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T(\\lambda) = 10^{-A(\\lambda)}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can solve for the absorbance as \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "A(\\lambda) &= -log_{10}(T(\\lambda) \\\\\n",
    "&= -log_{10} \\left( \\frac{I_t(\\lambda)}{I_i(\\lambda)} \\right)  \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Absorbance Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "The absorbance $A_j$ at a given wavelength, $\\lambda_j$, is calculated according to\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "b_j &= \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N{m^i_{j}} - d_j \\\\\n",
    "T_j &= \\frac{b_j}{u_j} \\\\\n",
    "A_j &= -\\log_{10}(T_j)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "b_j &= \\text{dark-corrected average spectrum measurement at } j^{th} \\text{wavelength} \\\\\n",
    "T_j &= \\text{Transmittance at } j^{th} \\text{wavelength} \\\\\n",
    "A_j &= \\text{Absorbance at } j^{th} \\text{wavelength} \\\\\n",
    "m^i_j &= \\text{measurement at } j^{th} \\text{wavelength in } i^{th} \\text{file} \\\\\n",
    "d_{j} &= \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{d^i_{j}} = \\text{average dark measurement at } j^{th} \\text{wavelength} \\\\\n",
    "u_{j} &= \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{u^i_{j}} - d_j = \\text{average dark-corrected measurement at } j^{th} \\text{wavelength prior to filling sample with resin} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it is important to subtract the measured dark signal at each wavelength from the corresponding resin and no-resin measurements. The dark signal originates from an accumulation of electrons in each spectrometer detector pixel during the integration time even when no light is incident on the pixel. As such it represents a spurious signal in the spectrum measurement (in the form of a constant offset for a given integration time), which is easily corrected by simply subtracting the average dark signal from each measurement."
